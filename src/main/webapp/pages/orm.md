Circumflex ORM   {#orm}
==============

Circumflex ORM is an [Object/Relational Mapping (ORM)][orm-wiki] framework for creating fast,
concise and efficient data-centric applications with elegant DSL.

The term [Object/Relational Mapping (ORM)][orm-wiki] refers to the technique of mapping
a data representation from an object model to a relational data model. ORM tools may
significantly speed up development by eliminating boilerplates for common
[CRUD (create-read-update-delete)][crud-wiki] operations, make applications more portable by
incapsulating vendor-specific SQL dialects, provide object-oriented API for querying,
allow navigating associations between objects transparently and much more.
